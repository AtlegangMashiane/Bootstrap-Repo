        <strong>Intercommunication Circuit Design</strong><br><br>

        <strong>Objective:</strong><br>
        The objective was to design and build a simple intercommunication circuit using a microphone and earphones.<br><br>
    
        <strong>Materials:</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Resistors: 1kΩ, 10kΩ, 120kΩ, 2x 3k3Ω, 100kΩ potentiometer</li>
            <li>Capacitors: 1μF, 100μF</li>
            <li>9V Battery</li>
            <li>Electret Microphone</li>
            <li>PCB mount mono jack connector socket (2 pole, 3.5mm)</li>
            <li>Soldering station, wires, function generator, digital oscilloscope, and multimeter</li>
        </ul><br>
    
        <strong>Procedure:</strong><br>
        - The circuit was designed and simulated using Proteus software.<br>
        - Various resistors and capacitors were connected in parallel and series to establish the power flow.<br>
        - The microphone and headphone jack were connected to the operational amplifier IC 741.<br>
        - Voltage drops were measured, and the circuit’s integrity was verified using a multimeter.<br><br>
    
        <strong>Results:</strong><br>
        Voltage measurements across different components confirmed the correct operation of the circuit with no faults. A practical intercommunication system was successfully created.<br><br>
    
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
        The project achieved its objective of creating a functional intercommunication circuit, demonstrating proficiency in circuit design, simulation, and testing.
